About
-----

This module extends the search box so it gives back search results while typing. It currently supports two ways of displaying these search suggestions: clickable title or by an extra view mode 'live results search'. With the view mode support you have full control on how you will show the live results.

It's fully inspired by the Search API autocomplete module, but instead of giving back keywords, this module will give back content matches.

--Angie's edits--
This module was further edited on 8/3/15 in order to sort results by content type and limit the amount of results displayed for each. For setup instructions, see https://jam4.sapjam.com/blogs/show/4k17dw5ssMR6uedx6QiLJh
