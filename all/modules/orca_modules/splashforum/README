This is a Splash Forum service that has a Retrieve ( by Forum Id ) and Index ( All Forums ) method.
These API�s can also provide the Forum Topics.

There are two url parameters:

1.	Page � number of Forum Topics per Page, the default value is 6.
2.	Sortby � for the Forum Topics, default value is 1.
    a.	1 � Date � newest
    b.	2 � Date � oldest
    c.	3 � Forum Topic with most Comments first
    d.	4 � Forum Topic with least Comments first

These Api�s use the same function calls as the Drupal UI for Forums.

Method Retrieve
Retrieve Forum by Forum Id

One observation is that when calling for a TID the num_topics and num_posts are not returned, it is assumed that the list of Forums was already returned and it contained that information so it is not required when calling for an individual Forum. I can add the necessary database logic if necessary.
